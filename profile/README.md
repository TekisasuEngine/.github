## Who is this for? Where can I join the Tekisasu community?

Tekisasu Engine is primarily developed for video games being
developed by Tekisasu. While we will make the releases available
to the public, it is not meant for public use.

If you're looking for an excellent game development community, 
be sure to check out the new [Blazium](https://blazium.app/) engine community, of which
this project will follow with currated soft forks.  Any changes
made to Blazium will inevitably flow back into Tekisasu Engine,
so if you would like to contribute, please contribute there.
